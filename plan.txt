voxel ray marching

GRID 
grid can be represented as 3D texture (memory heavy, fast)
grid can be represented as sparse octree (momory efficient, slow)


GRID TRAVERSAL
ray marching using DDA algorithm 


MODELS
Models can be converted from mesh to voxel grid using online resources






PLAN:
1. start with 3D textures and DDA/(or fixed step) raymarch a model on GPU
2. optimize
3. edit terrain
